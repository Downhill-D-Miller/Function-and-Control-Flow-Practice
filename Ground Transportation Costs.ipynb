    "One decides to take a trip to Seattle. There are many options for getting around the city. If one does not mind sitting next to random strangers on a crowded bus, public transportation is an option. Other options include getting around by taxi, Lyft, or providing your own transportatin by renting a car. Which options are the cheapest? It would probably depend on how much you need to get around the city. Trips covering large amounts of distance with lengthy trip times might add up quickly to where renting a car may be the more viable option. To help calculate the cost of getting around using the various methods excluding public transportation, some functions will be set up to help figure out the total costs. The goal of this project is to assume someone wants to figure out how much they will spend depending on which option they choose. They would be able to approximate their costs by knowing how far they will travel and plugging in various time ranges.\n",
