In this project, I decided to get more practice with defining functions and using control flow within them. A couple
of hypothetical scenarios were used where an individiual is attempting to choose between taking the Taxi, Lyft, or Uber and determining 
the approximate cost of such a trip. Along with some control flow, some input statements were assignmed to variables that were used within a 
function. The function would then return a statement back to the user. Another function generating a random wait time was also created.
At the end, the input statement variables are plugged into the functions defined earlier on in determing the approximate cost of the trip.
The results are statements to the user telling them the approximate cost of their trip if they use a taxi service or some other ridesharing 
service.
